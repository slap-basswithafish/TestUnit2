                        <p>Windows 95 was a moderately successful version of Windows that’s features would influence future Windows systems. Windows 95 was released in August of 1995. Windows 95 began development March 1992 before the release of Windows 3.1. Microsoft's plan was to create a new High-end GUI dubbed “Cairo” and another system named “Chicago” that would be used as the basis for future Windows systems. Cairo, however, eventually would be scrapped, but ideas from Cairo would be mixed with Chicago to create the prototype of Windows 95. After a brief beta testing period, Windows 95 would be released running on MS-DOS on August 24th, 1995. Windows 95 was the first to run on DOS and had a large marketing campaign involving people like the Rolling Stones, Weezer, and Edie Brickell.  Windows 95 added a few new features such as a Plug and Play device manager, long file names, 32-bit processor, sticky keys, filter keys, toggle keys, mouse keys, and accessibility API. Windows 95 could also be upgraded with Windows 2000 professional, or Windows Me. Windows 95 would also eventually get access to Internet Explorer. In its lifetime it could use Internet Explorer 1, 2, 3, and 4. Many of the features added would become key components to the Windows series of products, such as the start menu and the taskbar. When Windows 95 released it was received well by the public, with sales of one million copies within 4 days of its release. Windows 95 was a successful system in the lineage of Windows, having many features that would stay with the future systems and selling very well.   </p>
