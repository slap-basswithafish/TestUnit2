                        <p>Windows 7 was a huge improvement over Vista that came before it. Windows 7 was released in October of 2009. Windows 7 began development after the release of Vista and was a response to the disaster that was Vista. Bill Gates stated that he hoped the new OS would be more user-centric than its predecessor and would focus on improving the performance issues that Vista suffered from. When in development Windows 7 was described as an improved version of Vista. In 2008 a new reworked taskbar was shown off and its beta was leaked on to the internet, when tested Windows 7 beat both Vista and Windows XP in terms of loading times. Windows 7 would be released October 22nd, 2009, to critical acclaim and being praised as a huge improvement over Vista. Windows 7 would add improved performance on multi-core processors, DirectAccess improvements, kernel improvements, more graphics card support, an updated version of Windows Media Center, Windows PowerShell, and a heavily changed task bar. Some features of Vista were removed in the jump to Windows 7, such as the classic start menu styling, taskbar features, Windows Explorer features, and the exclusion of Windows Movie Maker, Photo Gallery, Calendar, and Mail. On release Windows 7 became the highest-grossing pre order sale on amazon and sold around 100 million copies six months after release, blowing Vistas sales out of the water. Windows 7 was a return to form for Microsoft, fixing many problems of Vista and paving the way for future Windows systems.  </p>
