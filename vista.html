                    <p>Windows Vista was an OS released to the public on January 30th, 2007. Vista came after Windows XP with a five-year gap between the two releases. It was originally intended to just be a small release before the next major windows release but eventually became the next big release. During initial development Vista was referred to as “Longhorn”. In the initial stages of Longhorn, it was mostly just small improvements to the framework of Windows XP, Later things like Aero and a new taskbar. After some setbacks in creating Longhorn that prevented the OS from operating smoothly Microsoft decided to reset development on Longhorn to create what would eventually be known as Vista. Before it was released there were many beta tests and troubleshooting. Microsoft had hoped to release Vista on the Holiday season of 2006, but it was pushed back to 2007. When it came out there were some changes to it made compared to XP. Such as an improved GUI, a new visual style Aero, Windows Search, redesigned networking, new sub-systems, the windows sidebar, Windows Defender, parental controls, and improved file sharing across devices. These changes and additions were well received by the majority of users. However, there were also a great many problems with the new OS. It had terribly high system requirements for the time. As well as excessively long loading times, very many pop-ups, and restrictive licensing terms. Overall Vista was written off as a market failure as it sold less than its predecessor XP did, sales of Windows XP ceased on October 22, 2010. It would eventually be replaced by Windows 7.  </p>
