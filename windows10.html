                        <p>Windows 10 is the second most recent version of Windows and the direct successor to Windows 8, released to the public in July of 2015. The development of Windows 10 began with the goal of a single software ecosystem for PCS, phones, and other devices. At the beginning of development, Windows 10 was named “Threshold” and was only shown a few times in this period with showcases of a new start menu and the ability to run Windows Store apps in desktop windows, they also brought up the idea of a universal Windows app, uniting applications from Windows 8 and Xbox on the same code base. It would later be announced as Windows 10 September 30th, 2014. Before release, Microsoft mostly showed off the cross-platform features that it offered. They had an advertising campaign stating that there would be a more personal experience when using Windows 10. Windows 10 would be released July 29th, 2015, to a positive reception with people saying that it was better than its predecessor Windows 8. Features added with Windows 10 are new universal apps that could run on multiple different devices, mouse and touchscreen support, new start menu, Microsoft Edge, fingerprint recognition, face recognition, TaskView, and DirectX 12. In the first of release 14 million people (about twice the population of Arizona) had bought Windows 10 and were running it. While impressive, Windows 7 was still used more overall worldwide than 10 was and would remain more widely used for years after 10’s release. Windows 10 did help to make an updated version that could unite multiple devices and remain successful in its market.  </p>
