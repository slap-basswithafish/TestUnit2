                    <p>Windows 1.0 was the first initial release of a Windows operating system released in a window from 1985 to 1986. It began development after Bill Gates of Microsoft saw a similar software on display at an expo and wanted to create something in a similar nature. The development of Windows 1.0 began with Microsoft wanting to differentiate its own system from Apples. Scott A. Mcgregor was chosen as lead developer for the project, and ended up choosing a tiled layout for the separate tabs open rather than an overlapping one. Microsoft showed the project in its unfinished state, at the time requiring 192 KB of RAM and being described as a device driver for MS-DOS and Microsoft hoped to attract companies to use Windows 1.0 by not having a set Microsoft user inference for applications. Gates viewed Windows as the future of Microsoft, and predicted that if they stuck with it, they would succeed. Windows 1.0 would eventually be released to a lukewarm reception on November 20th, 1985. As for things Windows 1.0 accomplished It could multitask many separate programs at one time, had full support for a mouse to be used, open .exe files in an application, have a playable game named “Reversi”, and had the programs Paint, Calculator, Notepad, Write, Terminal, and Clock. As stated before, it came out to lukewarm reviews, people saod that had not met expectations and was outclassed by Apple’s software. It was terribly slow in loading and the UI was confusing for the time with the mouse being a new thing that people were not used to. Overall, Windows 1.0 was labeled a flop by major tech companies of the era.  </p>
